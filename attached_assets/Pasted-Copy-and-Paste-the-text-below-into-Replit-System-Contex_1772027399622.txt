System Context & Objective:
We have an approved 9-task execution plan to refactor the OUVRO app into a zero-data-loss, offline-first architecture ("Enhanced Option A"). We are replacing a flawed fire-and-forget flow with a robust Store-and-Forward queue system.

You are now executing the first critical steps of this plan.

Immediate Directives:

Step 0: Define the API Contract (Crucial Prerequisite)
Before writing UI or backend logic, we must define the exact JSON payload structure for the POST /api/tasks/sync endpoint.

Action: Write the TypeScript interface/Zod schema for the payload. It must include:

localId (UUID generated on the phone for idempotency).

audioBase64 or transcriptionText (depending on whether Gemini transcribed it locally or if we are deferring transcription).

All required metadata fields previously captured in VoiceTaskScreen.tsx (priority, classification, etc.).

Output: Print this contract for review.

Step 1: Execute Task 1 (UI Merge)

Action: Analyze client/screens/VoiceTaskScreen.tsx and client/screens/TaskCaptureScreen.tsx. Merge the priority, classification, and metadata selection UI from VoiceTaskScreen into TaskCaptureScreen.

Constraint: TaskCaptureScreen must remain the single source of truth for UI. It must capture the audio and the newly added metadata, and prepare it for local queuing.

Step 2: Execute Task 2 (Persistence Upgrade)

Action: Upgrade client/lib/offline-tasks.ts and client/lib/durable-queue-store.ts.

Constraint: The DurableQueueStore must enforce atomic operations. It must accept the newly defined payload (from Step 0). Items must default to a pending_sync (or pending_transcription) status.

Execution Output Request:

Output the TypeScript interface for the API contract (Step 0).

Provide the refactored code for TaskCaptureScreen.tsx (Step 1).

Provide the updated code for offline-tasks.ts and durable-queue-store.ts (Step 2).
Wait for my approval on these files before moving to the backend endpoints or the sync engine wiring.
