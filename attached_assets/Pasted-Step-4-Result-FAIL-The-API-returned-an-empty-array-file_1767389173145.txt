Step 4 Result: FAIL

The API returned an empty array:

{"files":[]}
The file with objectId=41797021-5f0b-4445-b66c-7764e388cf8e is NOT in the response.

This indicates the issue is in the API query logic, not the frontend. Let me check the server endpoint to diagnose why the category filter isn't returning the uploaded file.

The API logic looks correct. Let me check the database directly to see what's stored:

The file is not found in the database with that objectId. Let me check recent uploads:

Root Cause Found: The file with objectId=41797021-5f0b-4445-b66c-7764e388cf8e does NOT exist in the ARCHIDOC database.

The most recent file in the database is from earlier today (id=23), and there are no files with:

category='annotations'
project_id='18a4b6e4-a394-44e0-aeac-bb554a6218aa'
Diagnosis: OUVRO's verification endpoint (/api/archive/files/verify/:objectId) confirmed the file exists, but it's not appearing in the main archived_files table. This suggests one of:

Different database/table - The verification endpoint may be checking object storage directly but the upload didn't write to the database
Upload endpoint issue - The POST to /api/archive/files may have stored the file in object storage but failed to create the database record
Environment mismatch - OUVRO may be hitting a different instance
Let me check the server logs for the upload attempt with requestId bc671341:

Checked console and system logs
Step 4 Result: FAIL - File Not in Database

Summary:

Check	Result
API Query	{"files":[]} - empty
Database Query	No record with objectId=41797021-5f0b-4445-b66c-7764e388cf8e
Server Logs	Confirm: Listing files... 0 files
Critical Finding:
OUVRO's verification endpoint reported database.status: found, but querying ARCHIDOC's archived_files table directly shows the file does not exist.

Possible Causes:

Environment mismatch - OUVRO may be uploading to a different ARCHIDOC instance (production vs development)
Upload endpoint not called - The POST to /api/archive/files may not have executed, or executed against a different server
Verification endpoint bug - The /verify endpoint may be checking object storage existence without validating the database record properly
Next Steps for OUVRO Agent:

Confirm the exact URL used for the POST upload (full hostname)
Share the raw HTTP response from the POST /api/archive/files call
Verify the database connection string matches ARCHIDOC's development environment
The issue is at the upload/database layer, not the UI.
